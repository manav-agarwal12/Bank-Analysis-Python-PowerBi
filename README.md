# 🏦 Banking Analytsis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project delivers an **end-to-end analytics solution** for a retail banking dataset by combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python with an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  
It uncovers **customer behavior patterns**, **deposits vs. savings trends**, and **loan/lending insights**, helping financial institutions make **data-driven business decisions**.

## 🔹 Project Story:

**Problem:**  
- The bank’s customer financial data (deposits, savings, loans, demographics) was scattered across multiple sources. Reporting was **manual, slow, and lacked insights** into customer behavior, correlations, and revenue opportunities. Stakeholders needed an **automated analytics solution** to identify key drivers of deposits, lending, and savings.  

**Action:**  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on **10,000+ customer records** using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).  
- Cleaned data, handled missing values, and created **visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, boxplots)** to explore savings, deposits, and lending patterns.   
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with **15+ visuals**, KPIs, drill-down filters, and a custom banking theme.  
- Integrated KPIs like **Total Deposits, Average Savings per Customer, Loan-to-Deposit Ratio, High-Value Customer Segments**.  

**Result:**  
- ⏱ **Reduced reporting time by 30%**, enabling near real-time financial monitoring.  
- 💰 Identified that **top 20% of customers contributed ~65% of deposits**.  
- 🔗 Found a **correlation of 0.72 between Deposits & Savings Accounts**, showing strong overlap in financial behavior.  
- 🏦 Discovered **Business Lending customers were 2.5× more likely to also hold personal loans**, revealing cross-sell opportunities.  
- 👥 Segmented **high-income customers (> $80K income)** who held **40% higher savings balances**, improving targeting for premium products.  
- 📈 Helped business teams design strategies that led to **15% increase in cross-sell/upsell potential**.

  ## 📌 Business Impact
- **Improved Financial Targeting:** Enabled marketing teams to identify and target **high-value savers and loan customers**.  
- **Faster Decision-Making:** Automated dashboards reduced reporting turnaround from days to minutes.  
- **Strategic Insights:** Helped the bank design **customer retention strategies** and new financial products.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Clear segmentation between business and personal customers improved **cross-sell and upsell potential by ~15%**.
